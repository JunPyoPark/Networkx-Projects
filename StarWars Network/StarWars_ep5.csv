5,3,1,PLAIN OF HOTH,EXT,LUKE,"Echo Three to Echo Seven.  Han, old buddy, do you read me?"
5,3,2,PLAIN OF HOTH,EXT,HAN,"Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?"
5,3,3,PLAIN OF HOTH,EXT,LUKE,"Well, I finished my circle.  I don't pick up any life readings."
5,3,4,PLAIN OF HOTH,EXT,HAN,"There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed, I'm going back."
5,3,5,PLAIN OF HOTH,EXT,LUKE,Right.  I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here.  I want to check it out.  It won't take long.
5,3,6,PLAIN OF HOTH,EXT,LUKE,"Hey, steady girl.  What's the matter?  You smell something?"
5,3,7,PLAIN OF HOTH,EXT,LUKE,Aaargh!
5,5,8,HOTH,INT,HAN,Chewie!
5,5,9,HOTH,INT,HAN,"All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand."
5,6,10,HOTH,INT,RIEEKAN,Solo?
5,6,11,HOTH,INT,HAN,"No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.  You'll know if anything comes around."
5,6,12,HOTH,INT,RIEEKAN,Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
5,6,13,HOTH,INT,HAN,No.  He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.
5,6,14,HOTH,INT,RIEEKAN,"screen) With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships."
5,6,15,HOTH,INT,HAN,"General, I've got to leave.  I can't stay anymore."
5,6,16,HOTH,INT,RIEEKAN,I'm sorry to hear that.
5,6,17,HOTH,INT,HAN,"Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man."
5,6,18,HOTH,INT,RIEEKAN,"A death mark's not an easy thing to live with.  You're a good fighter, Solo.  I hate to lose you."
5,6,19,HOTH,INT,HAN,"Thank you, General."
5,6,20,HOTH,INT,HAN,"Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it."
5,6,21,HOTH,INT,LEIA,That's right.
5,6,22,HOTH,INT,HAN,"Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess."
5,7,23,HOTH,INT,LEIA,Han!
5,7,24,HOTH,INT,HAN,"Yes, Your Highnessness?"
5,7,25,HOTH,INT,LEIA,I thought you decided to stay.
5,7,26,HOTH,INT,HAN,"Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind."
5,7,27,HOTH,INT,LEIA,"Han, we need you!"
5,7,28,HOTH,INT,HAN,We?
5,7,29,HOTH,INT,LEIA,Yes.
5,7,30,HOTH,INT,HAN,"Oh, what about you need?"
5,7,31,HOTH,INT,LEIA,I need?  I don't know what you're talking about.
5,7,32,HOTH,INT,HAN,fed up) You probably don't.
5,7,33,HOTH,INT,LEIA,And what precisely am I supposed to know?
5,7,34,HOTH,INT,HAN,Come on!  You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
5,7,35,HOTH,INT,LEIA,Yes.  You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...
5,7,36,HOTH,INT,HAN,No!  That's not it.  Come on. Aahhh - uh huh!  Come on.
5,7,37,HOTH,INT,LEIA,You're imagining things.
5,7,38,HOTH,INT,HAN,Am I?  Then why are you following me?  Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
5,7,39,HOTH,INT,LEIA,I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
5,7,40,HOTH,INT,HAN,I can arrange that.  You could use a good kiss!
5,8,41,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,Don't try to blame me.  I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater.  I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess' chamber.  But it's supposed to be freezing.  How are we going to dry out all her clothes?  I really don't know.
5,8,42,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,"Oh, switch off."
5,9,43,HOTH,INT,HAN,Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these.
5,9,44,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir."
5,9,45,HOTH,INT,HAN,Put them back together right now.
5,9,46,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,"Might I have a word with you, please?"
5,9,47,HOTH,INT,HAN,What do you want?
5,9,48,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,"Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator."
5,9,49,HOTH,INT,HAN,I turned it off.  I don't want to talk to her.
5,9,50,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,"Oh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke.  He hasn't come back yet.  She doesn't know where he is."
5,9,51,HOTH,INT,HAN,I don't know where he is.
5,9,52,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,Nobody knows where he is.
5,9,53,HOTH,INT,HAN,"What do you mean, ""nobody knows""?"
5,9,54,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,"Well, uh, you see..."
5,9,55,HOTH,INT,HAN,Deck Officer.  Deck Officer!
5,9,56,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu..."
5,9,57,HOTH,INT,DECK OFFICER,"Yes, sir?"
5,9,58,HOTH,INT,HAN,Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
5,9,59,HOTH,INT,DECK OFFICER,I haven't seen him.  It's possible he came in through the south entrance.
5,9,60,HOTH,INT,HAN,It's possible?  Why don't you go find out?  It's getting dark out there.
5,9,61,HOTH,INT,DECK OFFICER,"Yes, sir."
5,9,62,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire what's going on?"
5,9,63,HOTH,INT,HAN,Why not?
5,9,64,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,"Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia.  Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger."
5,10,65,HOTH,INT,DECK OFFICER,"Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in."
5,10,66,HOTH,INT,HAN,Not likely.  Are the speeders ready?
5,10,67,HOTH,INT,DECK OFFICER,Not yet.  We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold.
5,10,68,HOTH,INT,HAN,Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
5,10,69,HOTH,INT,DECK OFFICER,"Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly."
5,10,70,HOTH,INT,HAN,That's right.  And my friends out in it.
5,10,71,HOTH,INT,ASSISTANT OFFICER,I'll cover sector twelve.  Have com-control set screen alpha.
5,10,72,HOTH,INT,DECK OFFICER,Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker.
5,10,73,HOTH,INT,HAN,Then I'll see you in hell!
5,14,74,HOTH,EXT,THREEPIO,"You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do.  And my joints are freezing up."
5,14,75,HOTH,EXT,THREEPIO,"Don't say thing like that!  Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. Stupid little short-circuit.  He'll be quite all right."
5,16,76,REBEL BASE,INT,LIEUTENANT,"Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo."
5,16,77,REBEL BASE,INT,THREEPIO,"Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope."
5,16,78,REBEL BASE,INT,DERLIN,"Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight.  The shield doors must be closed."
5,16,79,REBEL BASE,INT,DERLIN,Close the doors.
5,16,80,REBEL BASE,INT,LIEUTENANT,"Yes, sir."
5,16,81,REBEL BASE,INT,THREEPIO,Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five... to one.
5,16,82,REBEL BASE,INT,THREEPIO,"Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes... from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry about Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll be all right.  He's quite clever, you know... for a human being."
5,17,83,HOTH,EXT,BEN,Luke... Luke.
5,17,84,HOTH,EXT,LUKE,Ben?
5,17,85,HOTH,EXT,BEN,You will go to the Dagobah system.
5,17,86,HOTH,EXT,LUKE,Dagobah system?
5,17,87,HOTH,EXT,BEN,"There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me."
5,17,88,HOTH,EXT,LUKE,Ben... Ben.
5,17,89,HOTH,EXT,HAN,"Luke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here."
5,17,90,HOTH,EXT,HAN,Not much time.
5,17,91,HOTH,EXT,LUKE,Ben... Ben...
5,17,92,HOTH,EXT,HAN,"Hang on, kid."
5,17,93,HOTH,EXT,LUKE,Dagobah system...
5,17,94,HOTH,EXT,HAN,odor) Whew...
5,17,95,HOTH,EXT,LUKE,Dagobah...
5,17,96,HOTH,EXT,HAN,"This may smell bad, kid..."
5,17,97,HOTH,EXT,LUKE,Yoda...
5,17,98,HOTH,EXT,HAN,...but it will keep you warm... til I get the shelter built. Luke inside the carcass) Ooh... I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
5,19,99,SNOWSPEEDER COCKPIT,INT,ZEV,"Echo Base... I've got something!  Not much, but it could be a life form."
5,21,100,SNOWSPEEDER,INT,ZEV,"This is Rogue Two.  this is Rogue Two.  Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rogue Two."
5,21,101,SNOWSPEEDER,INT,HAN,Zev's receiver) Good morning.  Nice of you guys to drop by.
5,21,102,SNOWSPEEDER,INT,ZEV,"Echo Base... this is Rogue Two.  I found them.  Repeat, I found them."
5,24,103,REBEL BASE,INT,THREEPIO,"Master Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again."
5,24,104,REBEL BASE,INT,THREEPIO,"Artoo expresses his relief, also."
5,24,105,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,"How are you feeling, kid?  You don't look so bad to me.  In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark."
5,24,106,REBEL BASE,INT,LUKE,Thanks to you.
5,24,107,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,"That's two you owe me, junior."
5,24,108,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,"Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer."
5,24,109,REBEL BASE,INT,LEIA,I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
5,24,110,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,That's a good story.  I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
5,24,111,REBEL BASE,INT,LEIA,"I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain."
5,24,112,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,"Laugh it up, fuzzball.  But you didn't see us alone in the south passage."
5,24,113,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,She expressed her true feelings for me.
5,24,114,REBEL BASE,INT,LEIA,"My...!  Why, you stuck up,... half- witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf- herder!"
5,24,115,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,"Who's scruffy-looking? I must have hit pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?"
5,24,116,REBEL BASE,INT,LEIA,"Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?"
5,24,117,REBEL BASE,INT,ANNOUNCER,"Headquarters personnel, report to command center."
5,24,118,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,Take it easy.
5,24,119,REBEL BASE,INT,THREEPIO,"Excuse us, please."
5,25,120,HOTH,INT,RIEEKAN,Princess... we have a visitor.
5,25,121,HOTH,INT,RIEEKAN,"We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east."
5,25,122,HOTH,INT,SENIOR CONTROLLER,It's metal.
5,25,123,HOTH,INT,LEIA,Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
5,25,124,HOTH,INT,HAN,"It could be a speeder, one of ours."
5,25,125,HOTH,INT,SENIOR CONTROLLER,No.  Wait - there's something very weak coming through.
5,25,126,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,"Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication.  This signal is not used by the Alliance.  It could be an Imperial code."
5,25,127,HOTH,INT,HAN,"It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out."
5,25,128,HOTH,INT,RIEEKAN,Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.
5,27,129,HOTH,INT,HAN,Afraid there's not much left.
5,27,130,HOTH,INT,LEIA,What was it?
5,27,131,HOTH,INT,HAN,Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct.
5,27,132,HOTH,INT,LEIA,An Imperial probe droid.
5,27,133,HOTH,INT,HAN,It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
5,27,134,HOTH,INT,RIEEKAN,We'd better start the evacuation.
5,29,135,DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,Admiral.
5,29,136,DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,OZZEL,"Yes, Captain"
5,29,137,DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,"I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had."
5,29,138,DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,OZZEL,"We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy.  I want proof, not leads!"
5,29,139,DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,The visuals indicate life readings.
5,29,140,DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,OZZEL,It could mean anything.  If we followed every lead...
5,29,141,DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,"But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms."
5,29,142,DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,You found something?
5,29,143,DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
5,29,144,DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,on the console screen) That's it.  The Rebels are there.
5,29,145,DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,OZZEL,"My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements.  It could be smugglers, it could be..."
5,29,146,DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"That is the system.  And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.  Set your course for the Hoth system.  General Veers, prepare you men."
5,30,147,HOTH,INT,REBEL CAPTAIN,"Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders.  As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch."
5,30,148,HOTH,INT,REBEL FIGHTER,"Right, sir."
5,31,149,HOTH,INT,HAN,"Chewie) Okay, that's it.  Try it... Off! Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Off!"
5,32,150,REBEL BASE,INT,MEDICAL DROID,"Sir, it will take quite a while to evacuate the T-forty- sevens."
5,32,151,REBEL BASE,INT,LUKE,"Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports."
5,32,152,REBEL BASE,INT,MEDICAL DROID,"Take care, sir."
5,32,153,REBEL BASE,INT,LUKE,Thanks.
5,33,154,REBEL BASE,INT,LUKE,"Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?"
5,33,155,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,"Hi, kid. There's got to be a reason for it.  Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right?"
5,33,156,REBEL BASE,INT,LUKE,Yeah.
5,33,157,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,Be careful.
5,33,158,REBEL BASE,INT,LUKE,"You, too."
5,33,159,REBEL BASE,INT,CONTROLLER,"General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four."
5,33,160,REBEL BASE,INT,RIEEKAN,Reroute all power to the energy shield.  We've got to hold them till all transports are away.  Prepare for ground assault.
5,34,161,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"What is it, General?"
5,34,162,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VEERS,"My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed.  Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system.  The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment."
5,34,163,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,The Rebels are alerted to our presence.  Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system.
5,34,164,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VEERS,He felt surprise was wiser...
5,34,165,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack."
5,34,166,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VEERS,"Yes, my lord."
5,34,167,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,OZZEL,"Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to... Aaagh!"
5,34,168,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"You have failed me for the last time, Admiral.  Captain Piett."
5,34,169,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
5,34,170,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system.  You are in command now, Admiral Piett."
5,34,171,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,"Thank you, Lord Vader."
5,35,172,REBEL BASE,INT,LEIA,"All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance.  The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded.  Only two fighter escorts per ship.  The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports."
5,35,173,REBEL BASE,INT,HOBBIE,Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?
5,35,174,REBEL BASE,INT,LEIA,"The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path.  When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point.  Understood?"
5,35,175,REBEL BASE,INT,PILOTS,Right.  Okay.
5,35,176,REBEL BASE,INT,LEIA,Good luck.
5,35,177,REBEL BASE,INT,DERLIN,Okay.  Everyone to your stations. Let's go!
5,38,178,REBEL BASE,INT,RIEEKAN,Their primary target will be the power generators.  Prepare to open the shield.
5,41,179,IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER,INT,CONTROLLER,"Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector."
5,41,180,IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER,INT,CAPTAIN,Good.  Our first catch of the day.
5,42,181,REBEL BASE,INT,WOMAN CONTROLLER,"Stand by, ion control... Fire!"
5,45,182,REBEL BASE,INT,ANNOUNCER,The first transport is away.
5,45,183,REBEL BASE,INT,DACK,"Feeling all right, sir?"
5,45,184,REBEL BASE,INT,LUKE,"Just like new, Dack.  How about you?"
5,45,185,REBEL BASE,INT,DACK,Right now I feel like I could take on the whole Empire myself.
5,45,186,REBEL BASE,INT,LUKE,in) I know what you mean.
5,47,187,HOTH,EXT,TRENCH OFFICER,Echo Station Three-T-Eight.
5,48,188,REBEL BASE,INT,TRENCH OFFICER,We have spotted Imperial walkers!
5,48,189,REBEL BASE,INT,CONTROLLER,Imperial walkers on the north ridge.
5,50,190,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,Echo station Five-Seven.  We're on our way.
5,52,191,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,"All right, boys, keep tight now."
5,52,192,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,DACK,"Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set."
5,52,193,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,"Steady, Dack.  Attack pattern delta.  Go now!"
5,54,194,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,"All right, I'm coming in."
5,54,195,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,"Hobbie, you still with me?"
5,59,196,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,That armor's too strong for blasters.
5,59,197,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,"Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables.  Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dack."
5,59,198,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,DACK,"Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control.  I'll have to cut in the auxiliary."
5,59,199,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,"Just hang on.  Hang on, Dack.  Get ready to fire that tow cable."
5,61,200,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,Dack?  Dack!
5,65,201,IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER,INT,VEERS,"Yes, Lord Vader.  I've reached the main power generator.  The shield will be down in moments.  You may start your landing."
5,66,202,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,Rogue Three.
5,67,203,"WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE",INT,WEDGE,"Copy, Rogue Leader"
5,67,204,"WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE",INT,LUKE,"Wedge, I've lost my gunner.  You'll have to make this shot.  I'll cover for you.  Set your harpoon.  Follow me on the next pass."
5,67,205,"WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE",INT,WEDGE,"Coming around, Rogue Leader."
5,68,206,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,"Steady, Rogue Two"
5,70,207,"WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE",INT,WEDGE,Activate harpoon.
5,72,208,"WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE",INT,WEDGE,"Good shot, Janson."
5,74,209,"WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE",INT,WEDGE,One more pass.
5,74,210,"WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE",INT,JANSON,Coming around.  Once more.
5,76,211,"WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE",INT,JANSON,Once more.
5,76,212,"WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE",INT,JANSON,Cable out!  Let her go!
5,76,213,"WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE",INT,WEDGE,Detach cable.
5,78,214,"WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE",INT,JANSON,Cable detached.
5,80,215,HOTH,EXT,TRENCH OFFICER,Come on!
5,81,216,"WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE",INT,WEDGE,Whooha!  That got him!
5,82,217,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,"I see it, Wedge.  Good work."
5,83,218,REBEL BASE,INT,RIEEKAN,I don't think we can protect two transports at a time.
5,83,219,REBEL BASE,INT,LEIA,"It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer.  We have no choice."
5,83,220,REBEL BASE,INT,RIEEKAN,Launch patrols.
5,83,221,REBEL BASE,INT,LEIA,Evacuate remaining ground staff.
5,84,222,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,"No, no!  No!  This one goes there, that one goes there.  Right?"
5,84,223,REBEL BASE,INT,THREEPIO,"Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand?  And ... do take good care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear."
5,86,224,IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER,INT,VEERS,All troops will debark for ground assault.  Prepare to target the main generator.
5,88,225,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,"Rogue Two, are you all right?"
5,89,226,"ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO",INT,ZEV,"Yeah.  I'm with you, Rogue Leader."

5,92,228,"ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO",INT,ZEV,Coming around.
5,93,229,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,"Watch that cross fire, boys."
5,94,230,"ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO",INT,ZEV,Set for position three. Steady.
5,94,231,"ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO",INT,LUKE,Stay tight and low.
5,96,232,"LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER",INT,LUKE,"Hobbie, I've been hit!"
5,97,233,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,You all right?
5,97,234,REBEL BASE,INT,LEIA,Why are you still here?
5,97,235,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,I heard the command center had been hit.
5,97,236,REBEL BASE,INT,LEIA,You got your clearance to leave.
5,97,237,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,Don't worry.  I'll leave.  First I'm going to get you to your ship.
5,97,238,REBEL BASE,INT,THREEPIO,"Your Highness, we must take this last transport.  It's our only hope."
5,97,239,REBEL BASE,INT,LEIA,Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters.
5,97,240,REBEL BASE,INT,ANNOUNCER,Imperial troops have entered the base.
5,97,241,REBEL BASE,INT,HAN,Come on... that's it.
5,97,242,REBEL BASE,INT,LEIA,Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports!
5,97,243,REBEL BASE,INT,HEAD CONTROLLER,K-one-zero... all troops disengage.
5,97,244,REBEL BASE,INT,THREEPIO,Oh!  Wait for me!
5,98,245,BATTLEFIELD,EXT,OFFICER,Begin retreat!
5,98,246,BATTLEFIELD,EXT,SECOND OFFICER,Fall back!
5,103,247,IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER,INT,VEERS,Distance to power generators?
5,103,248,IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER,INT,PILOT,"One-seven, decimal two-eight."
5,103,249,IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER,INT,VEERS,Target.  Maximum fire power.
5,105,250,HOTH,INT,HAN,"Transport, this is Solo.  Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon."
5,105,251,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,But... but... but... where are you going?  Uh... come back!!
5,107,252,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,Wait!  Wait for me!  Wait!  Stop!
5,107,253,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,How typical.
5,107,254,HOTH,INT,HAN,Come on.
5,108,255,HOTH,INT,HAN,"Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!"
5,108,256,HOTH,INT,THREEPIO,Wait!  Wait!
5,111,257,MAIN HANGAR,INT,HAN,How's this?
5,111,258,MAIN HANGAR,INT,LEIA,Would it helped if I got out and pushed?
5,111,259,MAIN HANGAR,INT,HAN,It might.
5,111,260,MAIN HANGAR,INT,THREEPIO,"Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir, might I suggest that you..."
5,111,261,MAIN HANGAR,INT,THREEPIO,It can wait.
5,112,262,MAIN HANGAR,INT,LEIA,This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
5,112,263,MAIN HANGAR,INT,HAN,"This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart."
5,115,264,MAIN HANGAR,INT,HAN,Come on!  Come on!  Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout.
5,115,265,MAIN HANGAR,INT,HAN,See?
5,115,266,MAIN HANGAR,INT,LEIA,"Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it."
5,115,267,MAIN HANGAR,INT,HAN,Punch it!
5,117,268,HOTH,EXT,LUKE,Artoo!  Get her ready for takeoff.
5,117,269,HOTH,EXT,WEDGE,"Good luck, Luke.  See you at the rendezvous."
5,117,270,HOTH,EXT,LUKE,"Don't worry, Artoo.  We're going, we're going."
5,119,271,LUKE'S X,INT,LUKE,"There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course."
5,119,272,LUKE'S X,INT,LUKE,We're not going to regroup with the others.
5,119,273,LUKE'S X,INT,LUKE,We're going to the Dagobah system.
5,119,274,LUKE'S X,INT,LUKE,"Yes, Artoo?"
5,119,275,LUKE'S X,INT,LUKE,That's all right.  I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.
5,121,276,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,I saw them!  I saw them!
5,121,277,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Saw what?
5,121,278,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us."
5,121,279,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Sir, sir!  Might I suggest..."
5,121,280,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Shut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield!
5,121,281,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Oh, great.  Well, we can still outmaneuver them."
5,123,282,STAR DESTROYER,INT,IMPERIAL OFFICER,Take evasive action!
5,125,283,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Prepare to make the jump to light- speed.
5,125,284,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"But, sir!"
5,125,285,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,They're getting closer!
5,125,286,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,eye) Oh yeah?  Watch this.
5,125,287,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Watch what?
5,125,288,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,I think we're in trouble.
5,125,289,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.  It's impossible to go to light-speed!"
5,125,290,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,We're in trouble!
5,128,291,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...!  Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners!
5,128,292,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.
5,128,293,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Oww!  Chewie!
5,128,294,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,That was no laser blast!  Something hit us.
5,128,295,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,"Han, get up here!"
5,128,296,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Come on, Chewie!"
5,129,297,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Asteroids!
5,129,298,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Oh, no!  Chewie, set two-seven- one."
5,129,299,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,What are you doing?  You're not actually going into an asteroid field?
5,129,300,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?"
5,129,301,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,You don't have to do this to impress me.
5,129,302,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one."
5,129,303,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Never tell me the odds!
5,133,304,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart."
5,133,305,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,I take it back.  We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
5,133,306,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,I'm not going to argue with that.
5,133,307,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,Pulverized?
5,133,308,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,I'm going in closer to one of those big ones.
5,133,309,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Closer?
5,133,310,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,Closer?!
5,135,311,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Oh, this is suicide!"
5,135,312,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,There.  That looks pretty good.
5,135,313,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,What looks pretty good?
5,135,314,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Yeah.  That'll do nicely.
5,135,315,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?"
5,137,316,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,I hope you know what you're doing.
5,137,317,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Yeah, me too."
5,140,318,LUKE'S X,INT,LUKE,"Yes, that's it.  Dagobah."
5,140,319,LUKE'S X,INT,LUKE,"No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. I'm not picking up any cities or technology.  Massive life-form readings, though.  There's something alive down there..."
5,140,320,LUKE'S X,INT,LUKE,"Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids."
5,142,321,LUKE'S X,INT,LUKE,"I know, I know!  All the scopes are dead.  I can't see a thing!  Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle..."
5,143,322,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,"No, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll have a look around."
5,143,323,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,Artoo?
5,143,324,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,Artoo!  Where are you?
5,143,325,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,Artoo!  You be more careful.
5,143,326,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,Artoo - that way!
5,143,327,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,Artoo!
5,143,328,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,"Oh, no!  Are you all right?  Come on.  You're lucky you don't taste very good.  Anything broken?"
5,143,329,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,"If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here?  It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy."
5,144,330,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,EXT,VADER,"Yes, Admiral?"
5,144,331,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,EXT,PIETT,"Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord.  But... it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk..."
5,144,332,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,EXT,VADER,"Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral.  I want that ship and not excuses."
5,144,333,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,EXT,PIETT,"Yes, lord."
5,146,334,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.
5,146,335,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but... does that include shutting me down, too?"
5,146,336,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive."
5,146,337,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable."
5,146,338,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Not entirely stable?  I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive."
5,146,339,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Oh!  Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior.  After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most..."
5,146,340,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Let go.
5,146,341,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Sshh!
5,146,342,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,"Let go, please."
5,146,343,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Don't get excited.
5,146,344,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,"Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited."
5,146,345,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Sorry, sweetheart.  We haven't got time for anything else."
5,147,346,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,Ready for some power?  Okay. Let's see now.  Put that in there.  There you go.
5,147,347,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,Now all I have to do is find this Yoda... if he even exists.
5,147,348,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,Still... there's something familiar about this place.  I feel like... I don't know...
5,147,349,DAGOBAH,EXT,STRANGE VOICE,Feel like what?
5,147,350,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,creature) Like we're being watched!
5,147,351,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,Away with your weapon!  I mean you no harm.
5,147,352,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,"I am wondering, why are you here?"
5,147,353,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,I'm looking for someone.
5,147,354,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,"Looking?  Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?"
5,147,355,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,smiling) Right.
5,147,356,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,"Help you I can.  Yes, mmmm."
5,147,357,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,I don't think so.  I'm looking for a great warrior.
5,147,358,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,Ahhh!  A great warrior. his head) Wars not make one great.
5,147,359,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,Put that down.  Hey!  That's my dinner!
5,147,360,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,"How you get so big, eating food of this kind?"
5,147,361,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,"Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just..."
5,147,362,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,"Aww, cannot get your ship out?"
5,147,363,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,"Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that.  Ohhh... you're making a mess.  Hey, give me that!"
5,147,364,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,the lamp) Mine!  Or I will help you not.
5,147,365,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.
5,147,366,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
5,147,367,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,"Ah, ah, ah!"
5,147,368,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,"Oh, Artoo, let him have it!"
5,147,369,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,Mine!  Mine!
5,147,370,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,Artoo!
5,147,371,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,Mine!
5,147,372,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,Mine!
5,147,373,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,"Now will you move along, little fella?  We're got a lot of work to do."
5,147,374,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,"No!  No, no!  Stay and help you, I will. Find your friend, hmm?"
5,147,375,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
5,147,376,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,Oohhh.  Jedi Master.  Yoda.  You seek Yoda.
5,147,377,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,You know him?
5,147,378,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,"Mmm.  Take you to him, I will. Yes, yes.  But now, we must eat. Come.  Good food.  Come."
5,147,379,DAGOBAH,EXT,CREATURE,"Come, come."
5,147,380,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,"Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo."
5,148,381,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?"
5,148,382,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect.  I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized.  I'm afraid you'll have to replace it."
5,148,383,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Well, of course I'll have to replace it."
5,148,384,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Here!  And Chewie...
5,148,385,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,... I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.
5,148,386,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help."
5,148,387,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Would you please stop calling me that?
5,148,388,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Sure, Leia."
5,148,389,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,"Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes."
5,148,390,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"I do, I really do.  You could be a little nicer, though. reaction) Come on, admit it.  Sometimes you think I'm all right."
5,148,391,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Occasionally... haltingly) ... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
5,148,392,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Scoundrel?  Scoundrel?  I like the sound of that.
5,148,393,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Stop that.
5,148,394,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Stop what?
5,148,395,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Stop that!  My hands are dirty.
5,148,396,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"My hands are dirty, too.  What are you afraid of?"
5,148,397,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,into his eyes) Afraid?
5,148,398,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,You're trembling.
5,148,399,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,I'm not trembling.
5,148,400,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
5,148,401,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,I happen to like nice men.
5,148,402,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,I'm a nice man.
5,148,403,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,"No, you're not.  You're..."
5,148,404,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Sir, sir!  I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling."
5,148,405,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Thank you.  Thank you very much.
5,148,406,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir."
5,150,407,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,NEEDA,"... and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes.  Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed."
5,150,408,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"No, Captain, they're alive.  I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found."
5,150,409,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,Lord Vader.
5,150,410,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"Yes, Admiral, what is it?"
5,150,411,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,The Emperor commands you make contact with him.
5,150,412,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission.
5,150,413,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
5,152,414,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"What is thy bidding, my master?"
5,152,415,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,EMPEROR,There is a great disturbance in the Force.
5,152,416,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,I have felt it.
5,152,417,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,EMPEROR,We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker.
5,152,418,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"Yes, my master."
5,152,419,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,EMPEROR,He could destroy us.
5,152,420,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,He's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
5,152,421,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,EMPEROR,The Force is strong with him.  The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.
5,152,422,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally."
5,152,423,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,EMPEROR,Yes.  Yes.  He would be a great asset.  Can it be done?
5,152,424,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"He will join us or die, my master."
5,154,425,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,LUKE,"Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now."
5,154,426,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,CREATURE,"Patience!  For the Jedi it is time to eat as well.  Eat, eat. Hot.  Good food, hm? Good, hmm?"
5,154,427,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,LUKE,How far away is Yoda?  Will it take us long to get there?
5,154,428,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,CREATURE,"Not far.  Yoda not far.  Patience. Soon you will be with him. the pot) Rootleaf, I cook.  Why wish you become Jedi?  Hm?"
5,154,429,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,LUKE,"Mostly because of my father, I guess."
5,154,430,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,CREATURE,"Ah, your father.  Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm."
5,154,431,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,LUKE,"Oh, come on.  How could you know my father?  You don't even know who I am. Oh, I don't know what I'm doing here.  We're wasting our time."
5,154,432,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,CREATURE,I cannot teach him.  The boy has no patience.
5,154,433,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,BEN'S VOICE,He will learn patience.
5,154,434,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,YODA,"Hmmm.  Much anger in him, like his father."
5,154,435,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,BEN'S VOICE,Was I any different when you taught me?
5,154,436,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,YODA,Hah.  He is not ready.
5,154,437,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,LUKE,"Yoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I can be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm ready."
5,154,438,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,YODA,"Ready, are you?  What know you of ready?  For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi.  My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. Ben, indicating Luke) This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm?  What he was doing.  Hmph. Adventure.  Heh!  Excitement.  Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!"
5,154,439,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,BEN'S VOICE,"So was I, if you'll remember."
5,154,440,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,YODA,"He is too old.  Yes, too old to begin the training."
5,154,441,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,LUKE,But I've learned so much.
5,154,442,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,YODA,Will he finished what he begins?
5,154,443,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,LUKE,I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.
5,154,444,CREATURE'S HOUSE,INT,YODA,"him) Oh, you will be.  You will be."
5,157,445,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,THREEPIO,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion..."
5,157,446,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,HAN,"I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio."
5,157,447,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,LEIA,There's something out there.
5,157,448,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,HAN,Where?
5,157,449,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,LEIA,"Outside, in the cave."
5,157,450,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,THREEPIO,There it is.  Listen!  Listen!
5,157,451,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,HAN,I'm going out there.
5,157,452,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,LEIA,Are you crazy?!
5,157,453,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,HAN,I just got this bucket back together.  I'm not going to let something tear it apart.
5,157,454,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,LEIA,Then I'm going with you.
5,157,455,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,THREEPIO,"I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. mysterious noise) Oh, no."
5,158,456,ASTEROID CAVE,EXT,LEIA,This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all.
5,158,457,ASTEROID CAVE,EXT,HAN,There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
5,158,458,ASTEROID CAVE,EXT,LEIA,I don't know.  I have a bad feeling about this.
5,158,459,ASTEROID CAVE,EXT,HAN,Yeah.
5,158,460,ASTEROID CAVE,EXT,HAN,Watch out!
5,158,461,ASTEROID CAVE,EXT,HAN,"Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock.  Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached.  They're chewing on the power cables."
5,158,462,ASTEROID CAVE,EXT,LEIA,Mynocks?
5,158,463,ASTEROID CAVE,EXT,HAN,Go on inside.  We'll clean them off if there are any more.
5,158,464,ASTEROID CAVE,EXT,THREEPIO,Ohhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly little thing.  Shoo!  Shoo!
5,158,465,ASTEROID CAVE,EXT,HAN,Wait a minute...
5,159,466,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,HAN,"All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!"
5,159,467,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,LEIA,The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...
5,159,468,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,HAN,No time to discuss this in committee.
5,159,469,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,LEIA,I am not a committee!
5,160,470,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,LEIA,You can't make the jump to light- speed in this asteroid field...
5,160,471,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,HAN,"Sit down, sweetheart.  We're taking off!"
5,160,472,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,THREEPIO,Look!
5,160,473,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,HAN,"I see it, I see it."
5,160,474,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,THREEPIO,We're doomed!
5,160,475,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,LEIA,The cave is collapsing.
5,160,476,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,HAN,This is no cave.
5,160,477,ASTEROID CAVE,INT,LEIA,What?
5,164,478,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,"Run!  Yes.  A Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware of the dark side.  Anger... fear... aggression.  The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight.  If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice."
5,164,479,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,Vader.  Is the dark side stronger?
5,164,480,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,"No... no... no.  Quicker, easier, more seductive."
5,164,481,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
5,164,482,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,"You will know.  When you are calm, at peace.  Passive.  A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack."
5,164,483,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,But tell me why I can't...
5,164,484,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,"No, no, there is no why.  Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm.  Mmmmmmmm."
5,164,485,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,There's something not right here.
5,164,486,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,"I feel cold, death."
5,164,487,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force.  A domain of evil it is.  In you must go.
5,164,488,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,What's in there?
5,164,489,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,Only what you take with you.
5,164,490,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,Your weapons... you will not need them.
5,168,491,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,Bounty hunters.  We don't need that scum.
5,168,492,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,FIRST CONTROLLER,"Yes, sir."
5,168,493,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,Those Rebels won't escape us.
5,168,494,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,SECOND CONTROLLER,"Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger."
5,168,495,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,Right.
5,168,496,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"... there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.  You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive.  No disintegrations."
5,168,497,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,BOBA FETT,As you wish.
5,168,498,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,"Lord Vader!  My lord, we have them."
5,170,499,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field."
5,172,500,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Let's get out of here.  Ready for light-speed?  One... two... three!
5,172,501,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,It's not fair!
5,172,502,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!
5,172,503,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,it) No light-speed?
5,172,504,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,It's not my fault.
5,172,505,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for."
5,172,506,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Turn her around.
5,172,507,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,I said turn her around!  I'm going to put all power in the front shield.
5,172,508,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,You're going to attack them?!
5,172,509,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer..."
5,172,510,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Shut up!
5,174,511,"STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER",INT,NEEDA,They're moving to attack position!  Shields up!
5,174,512,"STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER",INT,NEEDA,Track them.  They may come around for another pass.
5,174,513,"STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER",INT,TRACKING OFFICER,"Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes."
5,174,514,"STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER",INT,NEEDA,They can't have disappeared.  No ship that small has a cloaking device.
5,174,515,"STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER",INT,TRACKING OFFICER,"Well, there's no trace of them, sir."
5,174,516,"STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER",INT,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,"Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit."
5,174,517,"STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER",INT,NEEDA,"Get a shuttle ready.  I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area."
5,174,518,"STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER",INT,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,"Yes, Captain Needa."
5,175,519,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,Use the Force.  Yes...
5,175,520,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,Now... the stone.  Feel it.
5,175,521,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,Concentrate!
5,175,522,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,"Oh, no.  We'll never get it out now."
5,175,523,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,So certain are you.  Always with you it cannot be done.  Hear you nothing that I say?
5,175,524,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,"Master, moving stones around is one thing.  This is totally different."
5,175,525,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,No!  No different!  Only different in your mind.  You must unlearn what you have learned.
5,175,526,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,"All right, I'll give it a try."
5,175,527,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,No!  Try not.  Do.  Or do not. There is no try.
5,175,528,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,I can't.  It's too big.
5,175,529,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,"Size matters not.  Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm?  Mmmm."
5,175,530,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,"And well you should not.  For my ally in the Force.  And a powerful ally it is.  Life creates it, makes it grow.  Its energy surrounds us and binds us.  Luminous beings are we... Luke's shoulder) ... not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you... me... the tree... the rock... everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!"
5,175,531,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,You want the impossible.
5,175,532,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,I don't... I don't believe it.
5,175,533,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,That is why you fail.
5,177,534,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"Apology accepted, Captain Needa."
5,177,535,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,"Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  If the Millennium Falcon went into light- speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now."
5,177,536,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory.
5,177,537,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,"Yes, my lord.  We'll find them."
5,177,538,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"Don't fail me again, Admiral."
5,177,539,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,Alert all commands.  Deploy the fleet.
5,179,540,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?"
5,179,541,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,The fleet is beginning to break up.  Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.
5,179,542,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,I really don't see how that is going to help.  Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances.  The Empire may be gracious enough...
5,179,543,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Thank you.
5,179,544,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,What did you have in mind for your next move?
5,179,545,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away."
5,179,546,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,With the rest of the garbage. Then what?
5,179,547,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.  Got any ideas?
5,179,548,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,No.  Where are we?
5,179,549,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,The Anoat system.
5,179,550,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Anoat system.  There's not much there.
5,179,551,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"No.  Well, wait.  This is interesting.  Lando."
5,179,552,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Lando system?
5,179,553,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian.  He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel.  You'd like him."
5,179,554,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Thanks.
5,179,555,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Bespin.  It's pretty far, but I think we can make it."
5,179,556,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,computer) A mining colony?
5,179,557,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.  Lando conned somebody out of it.  We go back a long way, Lando and me."
5,179,558,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Can you trust him?
5,179,559,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"No.  But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that."
5,179,560,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Here we go, Chewie.  Stand by. Detach!"
5,179,561,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,"You do have your moments.  Not many, but you have them."
5,181,562,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,"Concentrate... feel the Force flow.  Yes.  Good.  Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see.  Other places.  The future... the past.  Old friends long gone."
5,181,563,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,Han!  Leia!
5,181,564,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,"Hmm.  Control, control.  You must learn control."
5,181,565,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,I saw... I saw a city in the clouds.
5,181,566,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,Mmm.  Friends you have there.
5,181,567,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,They were in pain.
5,181,568,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,It is the future you see.
5,181,569,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,Future?  Will they die?
5,181,570,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future.
5,181,571,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,I've got to go to them.
5,181,572,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,"Decide you must how to serve them best.  If you leave now, help them you could.  But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered."
5,184,573,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"No, I don't have a landing permit.  I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian."
5,184,574,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Whoa!  Wait a minute!  Let me explain.
5,184,575,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,INTERCOM VOICE,You will not deviate from your present course.
5,184,576,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Rather touchy, aren't they?"
5,184,577,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,I thought you knew this person.
5,184,578,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that."
5,184,579,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,INTERCOM VOICE,Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven.
5,184,580,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,Thank you.
5,184,581,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,HAN,"There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me."
5,184,582,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Who's worried?
5,187,583,LANDING PLATFORM,EXT,THREEPIO,Oh.  No one to meet us.
5,187,584,LANDING PLATFORM,EXT,LEIA,I don't like this.
5,187,585,LANDING PLATFORM,EXT,HAN,"Well, what would you like?"
5,187,586,LANDING PLATFORM,EXT,THREEPIO,"Well, they did let us land."
5,187,587,LANDING PLATFORM,EXT,HAN,"Look, don't worry.  Everything's going to be fine.  Trust me."
5,189,588,LANDING PLATFORM,EXT,HAN,"See?  My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay?"
5,190,589,CLOUD CITY,EXT,LANDO,"Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler!  You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled."
5,190,590,CLOUD CITY,EXT,LANDO,"How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you!  I never thought I'd catch up with you again.  Where you been?"
5,190,591,CLOUD CITY,EXT,THREEPIO,"Well, he seems very friendly."
5,190,592,CLOUD CITY,EXT,LEIA,Yes... very friendly.
5,191,593,CLOUD CITY,EXT,LANDO,What are you doing here?
5,191,594,CLOUD CITY,EXT,HAN,the Falcon) Ahh... repairs.  I thought you could help me out.
5,191,595,CLOUD CITY,EXT,LANDO,What have you done to my ship?
5,191,596,CLOUD CITY,EXT,HAN,"Your ship?  Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square."
5,191,597,CLOUD CITY,EXT,LANDO,Hello.  What have we here? Welcome.  I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility.  And who might you be?
5,191,598,CLOUD CITY,EXT,LEIA,Leia.
5,191,599,CLOUD CITY,EXT,LANDO,"Welcome, Leia."
5,191,600,CLOUD CITY,EXT,HAN,"All right, all right, you old smoothie."
5,191,601,CLOUD CITY,EXT,THREEPIO,"Hello, sir.  I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations.  My facilities are at your..."
5,191,602,CLOUD CITY,EXT,THREEPIO,"Well, really!"
5,191,603,CLOUD CITY,EXT,LANDO,What's wrong with the Falcon?
5,191,604,CLOUD CITY,EXT,HAN,Hyperdrive.
5,191,605,CLOUD CITY,EXT,LANDO,I'll get my people to work on it.
5,191,606,CLOUD CITY,EXT,HAN,Good.
5,191,607,CLOUD CITY,EXT,LANDO,"You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times.  She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy."
5,192,608,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,How's the gas mine?  Is it paying off for you?
5,192,609,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,"Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient.  And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... grinning at him) What's so funny?"
5,192,610,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,"You.  Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader.  Who'd have thought that, huh?"
5,192,611,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,"You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things."
5,192,612,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,Yeah.
5,192,613,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,Yeah.  I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.
5,192,614,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,Oh!  Nice to see a familiar face.
5,192,615,CLOUD CITY,INT,SECOND THREEPIO,E chu ta!
5,192,616,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,How rude!
5,193,617,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,That sounds like an R2 unit in there.  I wonder if...
5,193,618,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"Hello?  How interesting.  Oh, my."
5,193,619,CLOUD CITY,INT,MAN'S VOICE,Who are you?
5,193,620,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"Oh, I'm terribly sorry.  I... I didn't mean to intrude.  No, no, please don't get up.  No!"
5,195,621,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,Luke!  You must complete the training.
5,195,622,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,I can't keep the vision out of my head.  They're my friends.  I've got to help them.
5,195,623,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,You must not go!
5,195,624,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
5,195,625,DAGOBAH,EXT,BEN'S VOICE,You don't know that.
5,195,626,DAGOBAH,EXT,BEN,Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
5,195,627,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,But I can help them!  I feel the Force!
5,195,628,DAGOBAH,EXT,BEN,"But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force."
5,195,629,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,"Yes, yes.  To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave.  Remember your failure at the cave!"
5,195,630,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,"But I've learned so much since then.  Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word."
5,195,631,DAGOBAH,EXT,BEN,It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants.  that is why your friends are made to suffer.
5,195,632,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,And that is why I have to go.
5,195,633,DAGOBAH,EXT,BEN,"Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader."
5,195,634,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,You won't.
5,195,635,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,"Stopped they must be.  On this all depends.  Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor.  If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil."
5,195,636,DAGOBAH,EXT,BEN,Patience.
5,195,637,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,And sacrifice Han and Leia?
5,195,638,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,If you honor what they fight for ... yes!
5,195,639,DAGOBAH,EXT,BEN,"If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone.  I cannot interfere."
5,195,640,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,"I understand. X-wing) Artoo, fire up the converters."
5,195,641,DAGOBAH,EXT,BEN,"Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side."
5,195,642,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,Strong is Vader.  Mind what you have learned.  Save you it can.
5,195,643,DAGOBAH,EXT,LUKE,I will.  And I'll return.  I promise.
5,195,644,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,"Told you, I did.  Reckless is he.  Now matters are worse."
5,195,645,DAGOBAH,EXT,BEN,That boy is our last hope.
5,195,646,DAGOBAH,EXT,YODA,No.  There is another.
5,197,647,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape.
5,197,648,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,The sooner the better.  Something's wrong here.  No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
5,197,649,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,Relax.  I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
5,197,650,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,I don't trust Lando.
5,197,651,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,"Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend.  Besides, we'll soon be gone."
5,197,652,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,"And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?"
5,199,653,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,What happened?
5,199,654,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,Where?  Found him in a junk pile?
5,199,655,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,"Oh, what a mess.  Chewie, do you think you can repair him?"
5,199,656,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,Lando's got people who can fix him.
5,199,657,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,"No, thanks."
5,199,658,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,I'm sorry.  Am I interrupting anything?
5,199,659,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,Not really.
5,199,660,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds.
5,199,661,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,Thank you.
5,199,662,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,Will you join me for a little refreshment?
5,199,663,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,"Everyone's invited, of course."
5,199,664,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,Having trouble with you droid?
5,199,665,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,No.  No problem.  Why?
5,200,666,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,"So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the... uh... jurisdiction of the Empire."
5,200,667,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,So you're part of the mining guild then?
5,200,668,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,"No, not actually.  Our operation is small enough not to be noticed... which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves."
5,200,669,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?
5,200,670,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here.  But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.
5,201,671,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,We would be honored if you would join us.
5,201,672,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,I had no choice.  They arrived right before you did.  I'm sorry.
5,201,673,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,"I'm sorry, too."
5,203,674,LUKE'S X,INT,LUKE,"No, Threepio's with them."
5,203,675,LUKE'S X,INT,LUKE,Just hang on.  We're almost there.
5,204,676,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"Mmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take this off!  I, uh, don't mean to intrude here.  I, don't, no, no, no... Please don't get up.  No!"
5,204,677,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"Stormtroopers?  Here?  We're in danger.  I must tell the others. Oh, no!  I've been shot!"
5,206,678,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,Lord Vader.
5,206,679,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker.
5,206,680,CLOUD CITY,INT,BOBA FETT,He's no good to me dead.
5,206,681,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,He will not be permanently damaged.
5,206,682,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,"Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?"
5,206,683,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,They must never again leave this city.
5,206,684,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,"That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!"
5,206,685,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
5,206,686,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,No.
5,206,687,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,Good.  It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here.
5,206,688,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,This deal's getting worse all the time.
5,207,689,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"Oh, yes, that's very good.  I like that.  Oh!  Something's not right because now I can't see.  Wait. Wait!  Oh, my!  what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough..."
5,207,690,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,I feel terrible.
5,207,691,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,Why are they doing this?
5,207,692,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,They never even asked me any questions.
5,207,693,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,Lando.
5,207,694,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,"Get out of here, Lando!"
5,207,695,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,Shut up and listen!  Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
5,207,696,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,Over to you?
5,207,697,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,"They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe."
5,207,698,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,What about Han?
5,207,699,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.
5,207,700,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,Vader wants us all dead.
5,207,701,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,He doesn't want you at all.  He's after somebody called Skywalker.
5,207,702,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,Luke?
5,207,703,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,Lord Vader has set a trap for him.
5,207,704,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,And we're the bait.
5,207,705,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,"Well, he's on his way."
5,207,706,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,"Perfect.  You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? My friend!"
5,207,707,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,"Stop!  I've done all I can.  I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems."
5,207,708,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,"Yeah, you're a real hero."
5,207,709,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,You certainly have a way with people.
5,208,710,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,"This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor."
5,208,711,CLOUD CITY,INT,IMPERIAL SOLDIER,"Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class."
5,208,712,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,Good.  Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.
5,208,713,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,"Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it might kill him."
5,208,714,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged.  We will test it... on Captain Solo.
5,211,715,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position.  Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish."
5,211,716,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,What's going on... buddy?
5,211,717,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,You're being put into carbon freeze.
5,211,718,CLOUD CITY,INT,BOBA FETT,What if he doesn't survive?  He's worth a lot to me.
5,211,719,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,The Empire will compensate you if he dies.  Put him in!
5,211,720,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"Oh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!"
5,211,721,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,"Stop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear me?  Stop!"
5,211,722,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"Yes, stop, please!  I'm not ready to die."
5,211,723,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,"Chewie!  Chewie, this won't help me.  Hey!"
5,211,724,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,Save your strength.  There'll be another time.  The princess - you have to take care of her.  You hear me?
5,211,725,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,I love you!
5,211,726,CLOUD CITY,INT,HAN,I know.
5,211,727,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"What... what's going on?  Turn round, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh... they've encased him in carbonite.  He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is."
5,211,728,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,"Well, Calrissian, did he survive?"
5,211,729,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,"Yes, he's alive.  And in perfect hibernation."
5,211,730,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
5,211,731,CLOUD CITY,INT,IMPERIAL OFFICER,"Skywalker has just landed, my lord."
5,211,732,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,"Good.  See to it that he finds his way here.  Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship."
5,211,733,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.
5,211,734,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,I am altering the deal.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
5,212,735,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,"Luke!  Luke, don't - it's a trap!  It's a trap!"
5,216,736,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,"The Force is with you, young Skywalker.  But you are not a Jedi yet."
5,217,737,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,Well done.  Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet.  Move.
5,217,738,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,What do you think you're doing?
5,217,739,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,We're getting out of here.
5,217,740,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
5,217,741,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you?
5,217,742,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,I had no choice...
5,217,743,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"What are you doing?  Trust him, trust him!"
5,217,744,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,"Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie?  He had no choice."
5,217,745,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,I'm just trying to help...
5,217,746,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,We don't need any of your help.
5,217,747,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,H-a-a-a...
5,217,748,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,What?
5,217,749,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,It sounds like Han.
5,217,750,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,"There's still a chance to save Han... I mean, at the East Platform..."
5,217,751,CLOUD CITY,INT,LEIA,Chewie.
5,217,752,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee."
5,218,753,CLOUD CITY,EXT,BOBA FETT,Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.
5,219,754,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,Artoo!  Artoo!  Where have you been?
5,219,755,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry!  We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!"
5,219,756,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"Well, at least your still in one piece!  Look what happened to me!"
5,220,757,EAST LANDING PLATFORM,EXT,THREEPIO,"Oh, no!  Chewie, they're behind you!"
5,221,758,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,"You have learned much, young one."
5,221,759,CLOUD CITY,INT,LUKE,You'll find I'm full of surprises.
5,221,760,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,"Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to be true."
5,221,761,CLOUD CITY,INT,LUKE,No!
5,221,762,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,All to easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought.
5,221,763,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,Impressive... most impressive.
5,221,764,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well.  You have controlled your fear... now release your anger.
5,221,765,CLOUD CITY,INT,VADER,Only your hatred can destroy me.
5,224,766,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,The security codes has been changed!
5,224,767,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system."
5,224,768,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,Attention!  This is Lando Calrissian.  The Empire has takes control of the city.  I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.
5,224,769,CLOUD CITY,INT,LANDO,This way.
5,224,770,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,Don't blame me.  I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.
5,225,771,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,"What are you talking about?  We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon.  It's fixed!  Just open the door, you stupid lump."
5,225,772,CLOUD CITY,INT,THREEPIO,I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!
5,226,773,LANDING PLATFORM,EXT,THREEPIO,"Ouch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!"
5,226,774,LANDING PLATFORM,EXT,LANDO,Leia!  Go!
5,227,775,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me.  Of course, I've looked better."
5,230,776,GANTRY,INT,VADER,You are beaten.  It is useless to resist.  Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.
5,230,777,GANTRY,INT,VADER,"There is no escape.  Don't make me destroy you.  You do not yet realize your importance.  You have only begun to discover your power.  Join me and I will complete your training.  With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy."
5,230,778,GANTRY,INT,LUKE,I'll never join you!
5,230,779,GANTRY,INT,VADER,If you only knew the power of the dark side.  Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
5,230,780,GANTRY,INT,LUKE,He told me enough!  It was you who killed him.
5,230,781,GANTRY,INT,VADER,No.  I am your father.
5,230,782,GANTRY,INT,LUKE,No.  No.  That's not true! That's impossible!
5,230,783,GANTRY,INT,VADER,Search your feelings.  You know it to be true.
5,230,784,GANTRY,INT,LUKE,No!  No!  No!
5,230,785,GANTRY,INT,VADER,"Luke.  You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this.  It is your destiny.  Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son.  Come with me.  It is the only way."
5,233,786,BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY,EXT,LUKE,"Ben... Ben, please!"
5,233,787,BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY,EXT,LUKE,Ben.  Leia!
5,233,788,BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY,EXT,LUKE,Hear me!  Leia!
5,234,789,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Luke... We've got to go back.
5,234,790,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LANDO,What?
5,234,791,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,I know where Luke is.
5,234,792,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LANDO,But what about those fighter?
5,234,793,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,"Chewie, just do it."
5,234,794,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LANDO,But what about Vader?
5,234,795,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LANDO,"All right, all right, all right."
5,236,796,CLOUD CITY,EXT,VADER,Bring my shuttle.
5,239,797,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LANDO,"cockpit window) Look, someone's up there."
5,239,798,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,"It's Luke.  Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch."
5,241,799,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,"Okay.  Easy, Chewie."
5,244,800,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Lando?
5,244,801,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LANDO,"Okay, let's go."
5,246,802,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LUKE,"Oh, Leia."
5,246,803,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LANDO,"All right, Chewie.  Let's go."
5,248,804,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,I'll be back.
5,249,805,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,Star Destroyer.
5,249,806,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LANDO,"All right, Chewie.  Ready for light-speed."
5,249,807,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,If your people fixed the hyperdrive.
5,249,808,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LEIA,All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.
5,249,809,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LANDO,Punch it!
5,249,810,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LANDO,They told me they fixed it.  I trusted them to fix it.  It's not my fault!
5,251,811,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,"They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, my lord."
5,251,812,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon?
5,251,813,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
5,251,814,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,Good.  Prepare the boarding party and set your weapons for stun.
5,251,815,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
5,252,816,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,Noisy brute.  Why don't we just go into light-speed?
5,252,817,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,We can't?  How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?
5,252,818,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"The city's central computer told you?  Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch!  Pay attention to what you're doing!"
5,254,819,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,Luke.
5,255,820,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LUKE,Father.
5,256,821,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,"Son, come with me."
5,257,822,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LUKE,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
5,258,823,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LANDO,Chewie!
5,260,824,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LUKE,It's Vader.
5,261,825,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,VADER,Luke... it is your destiny.
5,262,826,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LUKE,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
5,263,827,VADER'S STAR DESTROYER,INT,PIETT,Alert all commands.  Ready for the tractor beam.
5,264,828,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Artoo, come back at once!  You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive.  Chewbacca can do it.  I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur!"
5,266,829,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,THREEPIO,"Oh, you did it!"
5,270,830,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LANDO,"Luke, we're ready for takeoff."
5,270,831,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LUKE,"Good luck, Lando"
5,270,832,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LANDO,"When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you."
5,271,833,STAR CRUISER,INT,LUKE,I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.
5,272,834,MILLENNIUM FALCON,INT,LANDO,"Princess, we'll find Han.  I promise."
5,273,835,STAR CRUISER,INT,LUKE,"Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal."
5,273,836,STAR CRUISER,INT,LUKE,"Take care, you two.  May the Force be with you."
5,273,837,STAR CRUISER,INT,LUKE,Ow!
5,275,838,GALAXY,EXT,THE END,
